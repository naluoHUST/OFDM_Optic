This repository contains detailed implementations and simulations of three prominent optical OFDM schemes used in visible light communication (VLC):

- ACO-OFDM (Asymmetrically Clipped Optical OFDM)

- DCO-OFDM (DC-biased Optical OFDM)

- LACO-OFDM (Layered ACO-OFDM)

The simulations are implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook to provide an intuitive and interactive environment for analysis.
